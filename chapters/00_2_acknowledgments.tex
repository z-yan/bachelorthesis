\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Acknowledgments}
First and foremost, I would like to thank my supervisors, Dr.-Ing. Maik Thiele and Dipl.-Inf. Michael GÃ¼nther, for the extraordinary support and advice they gave me. I am grateful to my parents for giving me life, for always encouraging me in all of my pursuits and for supporting me during my entire life. I would also like to thank to my sister Iskra who has always been both a huge influence for me and a great friend. Last but not least, I would like to thank Betani for all her love and for always being there for me.
